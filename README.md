Preparation
1. Download and Install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/
2. Execute the following command on command prompt to install behave & selenium
- pip install behave
- pip install selenium
3. IDE: I have used PyCharm Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download or you can use VS Code too

How to Run
1. Make sure you have done all the preparations
2. Clone Repository
3. Then if you want to run a single test for that feature, use the -n or --name flag which seems to want the text after Scenario:
- behave -n 'This is a scenario name'

You can run a feature file by using -i or --include flags and then the name of the feature file.
- behave -i file_name.feature
